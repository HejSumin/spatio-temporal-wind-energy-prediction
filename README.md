# Spatio-temporal wind energy prediction using GNNs


## Tools


### Sample Dataset
A preprocessed record of wind power production from a European country. The dataset consists of 2 years of records divided into 1-hour intervals, and is in a static graph format. The wind turbines that are used here are randomly selected to preserve the anonimity of the data. Furthermore, due to confidentiality, raw data is not included in this repository. 
The sample dataset was generated with a threshold value of `0.001` using `static_graph_generator.py`.


### Pytorch Geometric Temporal
The prediction models are implemented by using [Pytorch Geometric Temporal](https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


### Usage

- Library installation
  ```
  pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+${CUDA}.html
  pip install torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+${CUDA}.html
  pip install torch-geometric
  pip install torch-geometric-temporal
  ```

  where `${CUDA}` should be replaced by either `cpu`, `cu102`, or `cu113` depending on your PyTorch installation.

  For more information on the library installation, please visit the documentation of [Pytorch Geometric Temporal](https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

- To run the prediction test with the sample dataset, simply run the `DCRNN.ipynb` or `LRGCN.ipynb` notebooks in the `validation` directory. 
- To create a new graph format dataset, preprocess the raw dataset by using `dataset_preparation`, then use `static_graph_generator.py` or `dynamic_graph_generator.py`.
